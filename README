SYNOPSIS
        use Alma::Analytics;

        my $api = Alma::Analytics->new(
            path  =>  '/shared/path/to/your/report',
            limit  =>  1000,
            apikey  =>  'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            host  =>  'api-ap.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com',
            saveto => 'filename-prefix',
            filter => '<xml filter code from OBI>',
        );

        until ($api->isFinished) {

            my $rows = $api->get;
            foreach my $row ( @{ $rows } ) {
                    print $row->{Column3}, "\t", $row->{Column1}, "\n";
            }

        }

DESCRIPTION
    Uses the Analytics API to extract data. Data is returned as an array,
    where each item in the array is a data row from Analytics.

    You need to run the report once with the saveto parameter to see which
    columns contain which data fields. It's not obvious.

OPTIONS
    path [required]
        The path to your Report in OBI

    limit [optional]
        how many rows per file? Somewhere between 25 and 1000, in multiples
        of 25. Defaults to 1000.

    apikey [optional]
        Your API key. This is hard coded in the script, but can be used to
        override the default.

    host [optional]
        The Analytics host. Hard coded, but use this to override.

    saveto [optional]
        A file name prefix for saving the incoming XML file(s).

    filter [optional]
        An XML-format filter for the report, created by copying from OBI,
        under the Advanced tab.
